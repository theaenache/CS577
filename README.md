This repo contains my coursework for **Principles & Techniques of Data Science (SDSU)**.
It’s shared for learning/reference only (and so I don't lose progress in my homework). **Please don’t copy or submit any part as your own work.**

Academic Integrity: These materials are my original coursework. You’re welcome to read them to understand the approach,
but reproducing or submitting this code as your own violates academic integrity policies. Please learn, don’t copy :)
